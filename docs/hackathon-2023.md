# Sage Hackathon

We are hosting a Hackathon for Sage in late August with preliminary dates August 30-31. The goal of this Hackathon is to dedicate a few hours to work through user applications, code and science examples in depth.

If you are interested, please fill out the [signup form](https://bit.ly/sage_hackathon_signup) as soon as possible and we will get back to you!

Prior to the Hackathon, we request that you do two things:
1. Ensure you have an account in the [Sage Portal](https://portal.sagecontinuum.org/).
2. Start working through the [Edge apps tutorial](https://sagecontinuum.org/docs/tutorials/edge-apps/intro-to-edge-apps) in the Sage docs.
