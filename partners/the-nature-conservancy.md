A Sage node, equipped with cameras, microphone, and meteorological sensors, was strapped on a 15 m tall tower. 2 pan-tilt-zoom cameras providing visible and infrared images will be looking at wildlife and the preserve to monitor the environment. The sky-facing fisheye camera provides complete sky view that will allow to analyze clouds and local weather condition. The dust sensor will measure quality of the atmosphere. The full list of sensors can be found [here](https://portal.sagecontinuum.org/node/W01B?tab=sensors).

The W01B Sage node is completely powered by renewable energe storage with 8 of 1 m x 2 m solar panels. This system not only provides power to the node, but also allows to analyze the local solar power production based on weather and cloud coverage, that can be obtained from the Sage node's sensors.
