<p>In April 2022, 4 Sage nodes (3 <a href="/docs/about/architecture#wild-waggle-node" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wild Waggle Nodes</a> and 1 <a href="/docs/about/architecture#waggle-blade-node" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Waggle Blade Node</a>) were deployed with an array of sensors (thermographic camera, air quality sensor, etc.) to collect data to better our understanding of smoke and wildfire detection.</p>

#### Thermal imaging was used to understand how air temperature can be used to detect smoke and the early warning signs of fire.
